# Week 44 review

This week, we have worked with Javascript and React. It has given us the tools of how modern front-end teams, are using JS and supplementing JS frameworks, such as React.


The tasks are divided into the folders, depending on which day the task is from. 

But the task from Thursday u can find here:[Thursday task](https://github.com/cwulfftorn/Week-44/tree/master/react-crud-rest-exercise)

The thursday task is not finished. I'm going to get the task done in the next few days. I also havent started on the part 2 of the exercises this week.
